# Flowy-Behelit
A game I made in Unity 2D, it is similar to flappy bird but follows Berserk theme. But you lose only when the pipes push u out of the screen.

This is a independent project, and a cumiliation of learning Unity 2D alongside C# for game programming for a week!!!.

The theme follows pre Eclipse state of the Crimson Behelit, flushed into a drain and trying to make its way to Griffith. The only issue is the Skull Knight is influencing the current (directly) :> .

Float in the Murky waters by jumping with "space", and try not to be consumed by the current.

work in progress. :(

Some screencaptors of the work-in-progress:
